<h2>Part 1</h2>
For each parsed range, I checked each ID. 

To check an ID, I divided it into two equal halves and used a pointer to step through each half. If at any point the characters don't match, the ID is not valid.

<h2>Part 2</h2>
Brute forced this part, but was informed by a friend that there's a linear solution involving rotations. Still thinking on it.

Checked each ID using every possible window size.
